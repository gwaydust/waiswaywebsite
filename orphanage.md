# One Thing You Must do in Your Life

One thing I must do in my life is be a volunteer at orphanage. 

I live in Hong Kong, an international financial city where quality of life is relatively high. I studied under nine year free and compulsory education plus Hi-tech school. As education comes relatively easy, I never learned to cherish it and paid little attention on study. The same with happiness, many people take it for granted (probably me as well).

Yet many orphans do not have enough happiness. In fact, there are orphans are all over that do not have parent, love, or life necessities from family. E.g. a chance to study.

We live in same world yet have very different destiny. I am more fortunate than the child who live in orphanage. The orphanage is good place to make me seize the day, volunteer and help those in need. It brings me joy that I am able to put smile on orphansâ€™ face. Thus I feel I must volunteer at orphanage.

We only live once. It is time to regain control of my life. It is time to thrive. Gift of roses, hard there are lingering fragrance. Being a volunteer at orphanage is a calling of my life. It will enrich the life of both orphans and myself.
